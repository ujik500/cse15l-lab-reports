# Week 10 Lab Report

## Overview
I found both of the testcases with different outputs (#194 and #509) by using the `vimdiff` command on the outputs of a bash script for loop. I have linked the test-files in the provided repositiory below:

[#194](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/8dd87e6914ae40a4321aac8e2483e349de40b03c/test-files/194.md)

[#509](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/8dd87e6914ae40a4321aac8e2483e349de40b03c/test-files/509.md)
